_Java web development creates applications and websites using static and dynamic resources. The static resource refers to HTML pages with images, and a dynamic resource refers to classes, jars, Servlet, and JSP. Java web development uses several packages, files, and online links. Java web development requires web archive files known as a WAR files._

_Java web development works on three main factors. These development factors show below._

- **Front-end web development using Java technology.**
- **Backend web development using Java server technology.**
- **Database management using Java database driver.**

_The above three factors create, update, remove, display and operate data or information._

- **Front-end web development:** _The front-end technology interacts with the user and Java interface. It helps to insert and submit data. Java web development uses JavaServer Pages or JSP for the front-end form or table._

- **Backend web development:** _The backend technology maintains and updates data of the database. Java uses Servlet, spring, and other advanced technology._

- **Database Management:** _It handles or fetches data from the database using the Java database driver. The Java technology uses JDBC, Hibernate to handle the database._

  - _They are easy to maintain._
  - _No recompilation or redeployment is required._
  - _JSP has access to entire API of JAVA._
  - _JSP are extended version of Servlet._
